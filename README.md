# MultiplayerConnectTik
A local-coop hybrid of connect4 and tic tac toe written in python with a persistent leaderboard

This was a built as a final project for my Unix Scripting class, where we were tasked with creating any project that used Python, Sockets, and MongoDB. I achieved 100% on the project! 

Here are some things I implemented/learned:

    1. Python: I implemented my project using Python.

    2. Sockets: I utilized sockets for network communication.

    3. Threading: I employed threading to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.

    4. MongoDB: I integrated MongoDB for data storage.

    5. JSON Handling: I demonstrated proficiency in working with JSON data, including parsing and serialization.

    6. Error Handling: I properly handled errors and exceptions.

    7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I organized my code into classes and methods, showcasing and applying OOP principles.

    8. Documentation: I provided clear comments and documentation within my code.

    9. Data Manipulation: I manipulated and analyzed data within MongoDB.

    10. Game Logic Implementation: I implemented the game logic for ConnectTik.

    11. Exit Handling: I implemented graceful exits from the program.
